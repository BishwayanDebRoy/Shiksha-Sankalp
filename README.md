# 🎓 Shiksha Sankalp - Empowering First-Generation Students

**Shiksha Sankalp** is a transformative educational platform designed to bridge the gap for **first-generation undergraduates**, providing them with essential resources, mentorship, and career guidance. This platform was developed as part of the prestigious **CODE FOR GOOD Hackathon**, hosted by **[JP Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com)**, where our team collaborated to create an impactful solution for educational inequality.

🚀 **Project Goal:**  
Empower students from underserved backgrounds by offering a centralized platform where they can access educational resources, connect with mentors, and receive career guidance to excel in both academia and professional life.

## ✨ Why This Project Stands Out

   Built to tackle a critical social issue, **Shiksha Sankalp** directly supports **first-generation undergraduates**, giving them access to the tools and mentorship they might otherwise lack.

3. **Scalable Solution:**  
   The platform is designed with scalability in mind, making it adaptable for other underserved student communities, expanding beyond the initial scope.

4. **Strong Team Collaboration:**  
   Each team member brought their expertise to the project, utilizing agile development practices to deliver a fully functional MVP in just **48 hours**.
